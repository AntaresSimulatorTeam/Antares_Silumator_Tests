# Antares_Simulator_Tests

This repository contains Antares studies meant to be used as tests for a first validation : Antares test code should know
how to run them and which results are expected for eac test.  

This studies are divided in 3 parts, depending on the duration a test takes to be run with Antares C++ code, in the sequential mode.
- short tests : less than 5 seconds
- medium tests : 5 - 30 seconds
- long tests : more than 30 seconds
